The links and items described here are of course incomplete and they are written for software development companies, the most stuff is probably usefull for other contexts as well

## system thinking

in software development often the process hwo teams are working is optimized but even if al teams work nicely, companies fail to be innovative and to work effective as a whole. The reason is that having all parts working as good as possible does not guarantee that they work together. That's where system thinking comes into place

This video my give you some hints why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLh7rZ3rhU

So if we agree that every process must be optimized as a whole and not as indenpendent parts, the question if how to do this.

One way is value stream mapping

### value stream mapping

'Value stream mapping is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. At Toyota, it is known as "material and information flow mapping".[1] It can be applied to nearly any value chain.' (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

**Step 1: A charter**

This is a continual process (monthly/quarterly/...), but since a good abstraction is crucial you should define for every run a charter:

Scope:

Topic: Which flow do you want to optimze ? Important is a End to End view and not to have only some departments involved, but at the same time you have a scope which is small enough to be discussed in a day of less than 10 people. Define a concrete startpoint, end point and paths which are not in the scope is usefull. Part of the scope should be clear restrictions as well in order to take sure that the solution does not include impossible ideas (e.g. like firing everyone). Having an idea of how long the changes should take to be finished and results are visible is usefull as well.

Organisational stuff:

Define how it will be executed, schedules, visualizations and so on

People and responsibilities:

Identify the persons you need to do the maping, which persons do you need to consult in case, ensure that they are onboard. Who will sponsor it and who will facilitate it and at the end who is responsible to drive it ?

Value and KPIs:

Define the value of it and make it massurable. How does it help the customer ?
What is the issue right now ? Which stakeholders benefit and hwo ?
Add some KPIs to track whether it was successful and to identifiy the current state.

**Step 2: The current state**

Start with the status quo.
A building blocks/process is an action. It is connected downstream to the next action.
Having more than about 15 blocks will make the work pretty difficult, so find an abstraction which fits.
Put the building blocks on post its.I nterview the people who do the actual work to find blocks and connections.

After you have defined a first rough version, you should now add more details:

* define the tools which are needed for communication / handover of information.
Put this tools on additional post its and connect the processes which use them.
* Percentage of work handed to next downstream step

Add some KPIs / flow data to it, for example:

* working time = task time, time needed to do the work including meetings for that task, 
without any interruptions, so without any waiting time, or context switches
* lead time = starting from the moment when the work was available up to the finish of the work, including all waiting time and waste.
* Percentage complete = percentage of work which could be used by the following downstream steps without
any correction or re-work 
* WIP
* Number of persons available for that step

Barriers and impediments like:

* waiting because of batches
* downtimes / technical issues
* missing resources
* missing or not available staff
* Task switching
* Priorization rules 

Sum it up, by calculating some (2-5) overall KPIs like:

* Percentage complete for the full process (items which needed no rework at all).
* lead times in total
* working time in total
* activity rate = working times / lead time
* directly affected business KPIs 
 
**Step 3: The future state** 

Improvements can be everywhere. In case you need inspiration, here are some hints where to search:

* Where are the biggest findings in regard to the KPIs ?  
* Are there blocks which do not add value ?
* Are there delays or big waiting times ?
* Do you have redundant processes ?
* Can you do things in parallel ?
* Percentage of completion is low in specific steps ?
* work efforts ?
* unnecessary handovers which can be removed by crossfunctional teams ?
* do you maybe lack some handovers ?
* resources missing somewhere ?
* high load or bottlenecks ?
* well organised synchronisation of work ? 
* All stakeholders involved ?
* Can you combine or devide processes to improve the flow ? 
* Are there big variations in some processes, which indicate different type of flows ?
* Does the priorisation rules make sense ?
* Does it make sense to move redundant work/technologies to shared services or 
does it make sense to split/decouple shared work/technologies ?
* does the effort fit the the generated value ?
* Are there policies or reporting structures in place which slow down the work ?
* Are there wrong KPIs in place which motivate wrong behaviour
* Is the behaviour promoted which lead to a overall better flow ?
* Is the flow optimized for the key process or for minor ones ?

Define the future map, and write down the new KPIs you would expect after the migration.
 
**Step 4: execute the change**  

After you defined a future state, you have to define the concrete steps to reach that state.
For each change you need a responsible person.
On a regular base it make sense to compare oversee the success in the different steps and 
to compare the improvement to the expected one. 
Select one person to follow up on the results.
The initial plans will change and will need adaptions over the migration.

For any change in the organisation, you need the key players and the upper management onboard.
Additionally you have to socialize change, means making it transparent, explaining it in personal
chats and so on. Often it makes sense to test the change in a small area (Pilot/prototype) before
rolling it out on a wider scale.

Improvements should be done in a continous way. That means doing a value stream map and 
execute changes can only be a starting point. It doesn't matter how you solve it but you
need people who feel responsible on cont. improvements and are empowered to do so.
Some companies try this by having empowered agile coaches, 
other may have a community of practice (it needs to be empowered), in most cases it is triggered by the upper 
management layers only in few cases this might come from the bottom layers. You can only improve if 
the put improvement into the DNA of a company.
