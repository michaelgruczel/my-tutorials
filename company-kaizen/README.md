The links and items described here are of course incomplete and they are written for software development companies, the most stuff is probably usefull for other contexts as well

## system thinking

in software development often the process hwo teams are working is optimized but even if al teams work nicely, companies fail to be innovative and to work effective as a whole. The reason is that having all parts working as good as possible does not guarantee that they work together. That's where system thinking comes into place

This video my give you some hints why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbLh7rZ3rhU

So if we agree that every process must be optimized as a whole and not as indenpendent parts, the question if how to do this.

One way is value stream mapping

### value stream mapping

'Value stream mapping is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. At Toyota, it is known as "material and information flow mapping".[1] It can be applied to nearly any value chain.' (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

**Step 1: A charter**

This is a continual process (monthly/quarterly/...), but since a good abstraction is crucial you should define for every run a charter:

Scope:

Topic: Which flow do you want to optimze ? Important is a End to End view and not to have only some departments involved, but at the same time you have a scope which is small enough to be discussed in a day of less than 10 people. Define a concrete startpoint, end point and paths which are not in the scope is usefull. Part of the scope should be clear restrictions as well in order to take sure that the solution does not include impossible ideas (e.g. like firing everyone). Having an idea of how long the changes should take to be finished and results are visible is usefull as well.

Organisational stuff:

Define how it will be executed, schedules, visualizations and so on

People and responsibilities:

Identify the persons you need to do the maping, which persons do you need to cosult in case, ensure that they are onbaord. Who will sponsor it and who will facilitate it and at the end who is responsible to drive it ?

Value and KPIs:

Define the value of it and make it massurable. How does it help the customer ?
What is the issue right now ? Which stakeholders benefit and hwo ?
Add some KPIs to track whether it was successful and to identifiy the current state.

**Step 2: The current state**
